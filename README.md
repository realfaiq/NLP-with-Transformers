# NLP-with-Transformers

This repository contains all the code which I am going to do and practice while my learning journey on NLP and Transformers with Hugging Face. <br />
The book I'm using is named <strong>Natural Language Processing with Transformers</strong> and the authors are <strong>Lewis Tunstall</strong>, <strong>Leandro von Werra</strong> and <strong>Thomas Wolf</strong>. </br>
It will contain some projects too. <br />
